I am throwing myself into the deep end again.  This time, I threw myself into the figurative pool of android app development.  Why android?  Simple.  I don't own a Mac (and getting it onto the app store will be hard). 

**Target Audience:** elderly, caregivers, pharmacists, nurses, doctors

**Objectives:** Retrieving medication data from the user, setting appropriate local and device alarms/reminders, sending data to Firebase

**Requirements:** simple to use, easy to see, connects user with device and caregivers

1. Wireframing

The app needs to simple and easy to use.  I drew up a wireframe to make sure I included all the features.  In the end, I got rid of the pop-up tool bar because it was not a shortcut - just an alternative route - which might make it confusing for the user.  

2. Android Studio

Yes, I skipped from wireframing to making the actual app. I did it because this project deadline is in a month.  WIP of course!
