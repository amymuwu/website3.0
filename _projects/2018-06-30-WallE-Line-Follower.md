First day of our design course and we got thrown into the deep end of robotics.  We were given schematics, IR Sensors, an arduino, resistors, potentiometers and wires (some of which had infinite reistance because they were broken on the inside).  

So I dug deep into the bag and pulled out this tiny protoboard and it reminded me of WallE.  Don't ask me how I made the connection but it just happened.

**Process** 
I'm not going to go much detail into the proccess of the project because it was nothing too exciting 
* tested out single motors and IR sensors
* designed circuit layout to fit on half a breadboard
* soldered components onto protoboard 
* wrote test code to check all the components
* wrote code for the robot
* designed chassis to be 3D printed on Solidworks
* put together the robot
* a WallE!
