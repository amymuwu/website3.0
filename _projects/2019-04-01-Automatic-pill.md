*Introduction:*

The goal of this project is to design and build an automatic pill dispensing device that is more affordable than the current market offerings.  We created a pill dispenser that is accurate, easy to use, secure and smart. We began looking for a solution when we realized it is very confusing for the elderly or the chronically ill to follow a complicated medication regime.  It is difficult to keep track of the timing and dosage of each medication.
