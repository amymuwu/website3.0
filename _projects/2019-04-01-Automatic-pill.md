description: Simpill allows seniors to stay on top of their complex medical regimens. The dispenser alerts the patient when it is time to take their medication and dispenses the correct dosage. Smart connectivity allows pharamacists and doctors to remotely see when the medication is running low and change the regimen if needed.

Introduction:
The goal of this project is to design and build an automatic pill dispensing device that is more affordable than currently available options, but that is accurate, easy to use, secure, and includes smart features. Members of our team noticed from past experiences that it can be very burdensome and confusing when an elderly or chronically ill loved one is prescribed a complicated medication regime; it can be difficult to keep track of the times when each medication must be taken, and the dose sizes required for each. As such, our team set out to create a device that could make following a complex medication regimen easy and stress-free.
