Smart connectivity allows pharamacists and doctors to remotely see when the medication is running low and change the regimen if needed.

## Introduction:

The goal of this project is to design and build an automatic pill dispensing device that is more affordable than the current market offerings.  We created a pill dispenser that is accurate, easy to use, secure and smart. We began looking for a solution when we realized it is very confusing for the elderly or the chronically ill to follow a complicated medication regime.  It is difficult to keep track of the timing and dosage of each medication.  

__Requirements and Objectives__

Through consulting potential users and healthcare professionals, we established the following requirements:

| __Requirements__                          | __Rationale__                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | 
| * Product must cost less than $100    | To make our product competitive cost-wise.  Current products retail at an upwards of $300|
| * Simple physical user interface      | To insure users with low motor skills will be able to use the dispenser         |  
| * Capable of storing  at least 28 doses of each pill | To make refills a monthly process                                | 
| * Capable of storing at least 5 sizes/types of medication | To make sure a user's medication can be properly dispensed |
| * Audio, visual and tactile alerts | To make sure the user will alerted even if they have a disability |
| * Mobile application and internet connection | To allow for pharamcists and doctors to input or change a patient's medcation regimen remotely |
